LMS React

In this part of exercise I implemented React in the front end for my LMS application built using Spring Boot on back-end.
The objective of this project was to implement a section of the Library Management System in React JS to make it a web application that the user can interact with online. Through this process I learned how to use React JS with the Flux pattern to create a simple web application. All requests made from this application were sent to the Node.js application.

Used gulp as a build tool for application as JSX is not understood by most of the browsers. Gulp is used to minify, uglify, broweserify big JavaScript application for better performance.
